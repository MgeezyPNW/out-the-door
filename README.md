# Out the Door
An application designed to make the sales process more efficient by calculating the immediate and monthly costs and commitments when buying a cellular phone from a retailer. It is designed for sales associates and store managers alike in order to stay engaged with the guest while laying out options that suite their needs. 

## Why use this?
These costs need to be calculated and broken down for each guest anyways. Calculating the costs with the guest helps them understand where their money is going and builds the relationship between the guest and the sales associate. Although this is an extremely important step, it is often tedious and time-consuming. I have personally found that the longer calculating these numbers take, the less likely it is that a sale will take place.
